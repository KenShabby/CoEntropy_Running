''' This class should be able to take a runner's heart rate info, whether it be 
Max HR, lactate threshold HR, or heart rate reserve. Then based on the type of
run planned (e.g. recovery run, medium-long run, aerobic run, speedwork) return
a list of heart rate zones from 1 to 5 with them breaking down like this:
        Zone 1: Low aerobic
        Zone 2: High aerobic
        Zone 3: Tempo
        Zone 4: Threshold
        Zone 5: Anerobic/Max effort
